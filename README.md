This assignment required me to create a multiple choice quiz that was timed, scored and where high scores needed to be collected and displayed using what we've learned to date about Web APIs as it relates to window objects, traversing the DOM, setting attributes, timers, prevent default, keyboard events, listeners, event bubbling, data attributes and using local storage. This assignment was a challenging one where I spent most of my time on the functions and less on the overall look. If I had more time, I would have spent more on making it look nicer.
